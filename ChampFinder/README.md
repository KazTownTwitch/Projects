**1)** Download and run **ChampFinder.exe** by clicking on it above and then clicking "Download". When you run the program, it could take up to 30 seconds to build the dependencies before it asks you the first question. It's a big download because it includes Python dependencies for people who do not have a Python interpreter installed.

Of course, if you have a Python interpreter, you can just run the **ChampFinder.py** file above and you don't need the .exe.

**2)** Feel free to examine the full tree by looking through the **ChampFinder.py** file.
